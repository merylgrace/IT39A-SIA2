Detailed Report

Introduction

This report investigates a study that studied at how Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) students' employment chances were enhanced by a collaboration 
with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The university's cloud computing program now includes AWS training. 


Summary of Key Findings

- According to the study, student performance was greatly improved with the integration of AWS training. 

- Students became more confident of their skills in cloud computing and had a greater understanding of the wide selection of employment choices available in the industry. 


Critical Analysis

The Strengths of the Study

- Students are helped by the study's application of real-world AWS training.

- It provided clear evidence of improved performance among students.

- Feedback from students was incorporated to understand their experiences.

The Weaknesses of the Study

- The study's findings may not be applicable to other contexts because it only examined one university and one program. 

- The study's sample size was rather small.

- The study focused on short-term results and did not follow students' performance in the job market after graduation.


Synthesis and Relevance

- According to the study, students' employability can be greatly increased by collaborating with business and offering practical training. 

- This successful partnership with AWS is an example for other colleges and universities. 

- The findings highlight the significance of matching university programs with the needs of the job market, particularly in fast changing industries such as technology.


Gaps and Opportunities for Further Research

- Track students' performance for a longer period of time in the job market.

- Examine the success of comparable initiatives in other academic institutions and fields.

- Examine the long-term effects on students' earnings and careers.

- Examine whether these kinds of partnerships are cost-effective and how other institutions could possibly implement them.


Conclusion

The AWS Academy case study offers valuable insights on improving students' employability. Despite its shortcomings, the study shows the value of collaboration 
between industries and hands-on training. To completely comprehend the advantages and determine the most effective way to apply this approach in higher education, 
further study is required.
