Detailed Report

Introduction

This report investigates a study that studied at how Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) students' employment chances were enhanced by a collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
The university's cloud computing program now includes AWS training. 


Summary of Key Findings

- According to the study, student performance was greatly improved with the integration of AWS training. 

- Students became more confident of their skills in cloud computing and had a greater understanding of the wide selection of employment choices available in the industry. 


Critical Analysis

The Strengths of the Study

- Students are helped by the study's application of real-world AWS training.

- It provided clear evidence of improved performance among students.

- Feedback from students was incorporated to understand their experiences.

The Weaknesses of the Study

- The study's findings may not be applicable to other contexts because it only examined one university and one program. 

- The study's sample size was rather small.

- The study focused on short-term results and did not follow students' performance in the job market after graduation.


Synthesis and Relevance

- According to the study, students' employability can be greatly increased by collaborating with business and offering practical training. 

- This successful partnership with AWS is an example for other colleges and universities. 

- The findings highlight the significance of matching university programs with the needs of the job market, particularly in fast changing industries such as technology.



Gaps and Opportunities for Further Research

- Track students' performance for a longer period of time in the job market.

- Examine the success of comparable initiatives in other academic institutions and fields.

- Examine the long-term effects on students' earnings and careers.

- Examine whether these kinds of partnerships are cost-effective and how other institutions could possibly implement them.
